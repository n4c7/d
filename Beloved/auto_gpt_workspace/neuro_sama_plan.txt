AI Creation Plan:

1. Determine the components of the AI system and break them down into smaller, more manageable steps.
2. Create a GitHub repository to track progress and organize code.
3. Begin coding the AI system according to the steps determined in step 1.
4. Create small tests to check each step of the plan and catch errors as soon as possible.
5. Continuously test and refine the code to ensure it is functioning properly.
