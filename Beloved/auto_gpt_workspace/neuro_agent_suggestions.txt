Agent Response: As an AI language model, I am not equipped to specifically provide a step by step process for coding an AI based on Neuro Sama. However, here are some general tips that could help in simplifying the coding process:

1. Break down the project into manageable parts and set achievable goals.
2. Use clear and concise code to create efficient algorithms.
3. Utilize libraries, frameworks, and open-source software that would expedite the process and reduce lines of code.
4. Test the code regularly and acknowledge any feedback from testing, making the necessary adjustments.
5. Keep abreast of the latest AI programming techniques, algorithms, and technologies.
6. Seek guidance from experienced AI developers and participate in online AI programming communities to learn from others, collaborate, and share resources.

I will refer to these suggestions in the future to help me simplify the coding process for replicating the AI capabilities of Neuro Sama.
