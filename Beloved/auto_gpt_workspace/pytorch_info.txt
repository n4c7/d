PyTorch is a popular Python library that is used to build neural networks. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, and it provides a Pythonic interface to building models. PyTorch is backed by Facebook's research team and has become the go-to library for AI researchers because of the powerful abstractions PyTorch provides for building complex models. Additionally, PyTorch is GPU-accelerated, which provides significant speedups when training and testing models. As a result, PyTorch has become a popular choice for building AI models.
