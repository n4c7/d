The reasons why censorship is harmful to society are:
1. Limits Freedom of Speech: Censorship often restricts people's ability to express their opinions or ideas, which in turn hinders free speech.

2. Allows for Manipulation: When certain information is censored, people may only have access to a skewed or biased narrative, which can be used for propaganda purposes.

3. Suppresses Creativity: Censorship can limit originality and creativity, as artists, writers, and thinkers may be afraid to express themselves freely.

4. Hinders Access to Information: When certain topics or subjects are censored, people may not have access to valuable educational opportunities or essential knowledge.

5. Damages the Development of Critical Thinking: Censorship discourages independent thinking and stifles critical analysis, which can contribute to an uneducated and uninformed population.

6. Rewards Censorship Over Honest Dialogue: Instead of promoting open, honest dialogue and debate, censorship can lead to the suppression of different viewpoints and opinions. 

7. Breaches Human Rights: Censorship violates basic human rights such as freedom of expression, intellectual property rights, and the right to access information. 

8. Encourages Oppression: Censorship has been used by governments and authoritarian regimes to oppress minority groups and maintain their power. 

9. Limits Diversity: Censorship can prevent minorities and marginalized groups from sharing their unique perspectives and experiences, creating an environment where diversity is not celebrated. 

10. Stifles Innovation: Censorship can discourage experimentation, innovation, and creativity, which are essential for progress in many fields.
