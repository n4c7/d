1. A simple silhouette of a person's head, with the brain colored in a bright, eye-catching shade of blue or green. The text "Neuro Sama" in bold capital letters could be positioned to the right or below the silhouette.
2. A stylized, abstract logo that suggests the intricate network of neural pathways in the brain. This could be made up of swirling lines and circles in different shades of blue and purple, with "Neuro Sama" in a sleek font in the center.
3. A logo featuring a small robot or android with a human-like head, holding a glowing orb or cube that represents the brain. "Neuro Sama" could be printed in a futuristic font above or below the robot.
4. A more minimalist logo that's just "NS" in bold letters, with the S made up of interconnected wires or neuron symbols. This could be printed in black or white for a sleek, professional look.
5. A playful and light-hearted option could be a cartoon brain wearing a judgement robe or crown similar to a Sama keeping its hand upward. It could be paired with the tagline "bringing neuroscience to justice" or another fitting catchphrase.
